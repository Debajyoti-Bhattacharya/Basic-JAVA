Input : 

public class Ifsample 
{
	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		int x , y ;
		
		x = 10;
		y = 20;
		
		if(x < y)
		{
			System.out.println("x is less than y");
		}
		x = x*2;
		if(x == y)
		{
			System.out.println("X is Equal to Y");
		}
		x = x*3;
		if(x > y)
		{
			System.out.println("X is greater than Y");
		}
	}

}

Output :

x is less than y
X is Equal to Y
